# Machine-Learing-Project-1-Linear-Regression

This is my first machine learning project. Here, I have taken data from kaggle for movie budgets and gross worldwide revenue.
Firstly, I have cleaned the dataset in excel to prepare what I need to make the prediction. I have used linear Regression to predict the revenue of the movie based on the budget. 
Though there are many other parameters could be considered such as time to make movies, duration, genre etc. Here, I tried to make it as it is my first project. In near future 
I will try to take other parameters as well to make the prediction more accurate and well define. 

Check my code and saved images to have more better understanding.


Cheers!!!
